Two non-negative integers called siblings if they can be obtained from each other by rearranging the digits of their decimal representations. FOr example 123 and 213 are siblings. 535 and 355 are also siblings.
A set consisting of a non-negative integer N and all of its siblings is called the family of N. For example the family of 553 compirises three numbersL 355,535 and 553.
Write a function that, given a non-negative integer N, returns the largesetnumber in the family of N. The function should return -1 if the result  exceeds 100 000 000

For example, given N = 213 the function should return 321
